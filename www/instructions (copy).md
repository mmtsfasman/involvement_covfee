## Instructions

You will watch a series of video segments. In each video you will see a group video call snippet. For each video, we will ask you to evaluate the involvement of the group in the conversation.

### Definition of involvement
<p><q> The level of perceived personal importance and interest evoked by a stimulus (or stimuli) within a specific situation</q></p>


Based on this definition, we want you to assess the level of **group** involvement, which reflects the overall interest and engagement of **the majority of the group** in the current moment of the conversation.

### Your task for each segment 
You'll watch short videos of a video-call conversation. For each segment, your task is as follows:

#### *To what extent is the group involved in the conversation?*
Evaluate the extent of group involvement in the current moment of the conversation on a scale from 1 to 5,  where <span style="color:red">**1**</span> represents <span style="color:red">  **extremely low involvement**</span>, **3** represents **moderate involvement** and <span style="color:green">**5**</span> represents <span style="color:green">**extremely high involvement**</span>:

### Final notes before you start:
As humans and social beings, we are very good at reading others. We therefore are looking for your expertise and intuition in evaluating how involved groups seem in the conversation at any given moment. Please be assured, there are no wrong answers and rely on your human intuition. Your opinion matters!
 
We are interested in understanding how people express involvement and how it impacts group dynamics. Your answers will be used for scientific investigation purposes, and will not have any implications for participants of the given conversations.

If you encounter any issues with video playback or have concerns about the survey, please contact the experimenter on Prolific.

Do you commit to providing thoughtful answers?
